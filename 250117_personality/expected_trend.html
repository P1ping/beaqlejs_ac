            Thanks for your interest in participating in the listening test. This survey will roughly take 20 minutes. We would like to ask you some questions regarding personalities in real conversation. 
            
            The first experiment is to relate the personalities to conversation traits. We will give you one of five personalities and you are required to answer whether each conversation trait (e.g. Frequency of Laughter) is aligned with the given personality. Please check the following examples for better understanding. 
            <ul>
                <li>Example 1. If you think a person with personality A tends to laugh many times, you should choose “aligned” or “very aligned” for “Frequency of Laughter”.
                <li>Example 2. If you are not sure the duration a person with personality A speaks in one turn, you should choose “neutral” for “Talking Time per Turn”
                <li>Example 3 If you think a person with personality A tends to say fewer negative remarks, you should choose “opposed” or “very opposed” for “Negative Sentiment”
            </ul>
            
            Please first read the definition of the terms in conversation. Before you proceed to the next page.

            <h2>Definition of Conversation Terms</h2>

            <div id="demonat">
                <img src="img/overlap.png" alt="demonat"  width="300">
            </div>
            <br />
            <ul>
            
                <li><b>Turn</b>: A speaker's contribution from the start of their speech until they stop or another speaker takes over.
                <li><b>Overlappee</b>: the speaker/response that gets overlapped.
                <li><b>Overlapper</b>: the speaker/response that overlaps the speech.
                <li><b>Overlap</b>: An instance where the overlappee stops speaking before the overlapper finishes speaking.
                <li><b>Fully overlap</b>: An overlap where the overlappee continues speaking after the overlapper stops speaking.
            </ul>

            When the overlapper interrupts the overlappee and successfully takes the turn, this is termed a <b>successful interjection</b>. However, fully overlaps can result in either <b>unsuccessful interjections</b> or <b>backchannels</b>. These outcomes depend on the speaker's intention to take the turn. 
            If no such intention exists, the event constitutes a <b>backchannel</b>. 
            We categorize backchannels into two types: 
            <ul>
            <li><b>Emotive backchannels</b>: Express the listener's emotional state, such as "wow" to convey surprise or "Ew!" to represent disgust.
            <li><b>Cognitive backchannels</b>: Reflect the listener's cognitive state or thought processes like "Oh, I see" to indicate realization or "Ah!" for understanding.
            </ul>
            
            <br />
            This is the end of definitions of the terms we will use in the survey. You can now proceed to the next page. There are ways for checking your attention through the survey. If a certain number of the scores are answered unreasonably, you will not be paid. So, do not fill out the survey randomly.
